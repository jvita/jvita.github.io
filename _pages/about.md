I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Materials Science and Engineering department at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) advised by [Dallas Trinkle](https://dtrinkle.matse.illinois.edu/dokuwiki/doku.php). My research explores the construction and validation of computational models (i.e. interatomic potentials) used for atomic-scale simulations. My work centers around the development and use of software for fitting interatomic potentials, leveraging various global optimization algorithms and parallelization techniques. I am interested in machine learning for atomistic simulations, open-source software development, and high-performance computing. In my free time I enjoy volleyball, chess, and learning the ukulele!
